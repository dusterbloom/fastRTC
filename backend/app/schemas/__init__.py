# This file makes the 'schemas' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally import schemas here to make them available directly
# from the package, e.g.:
# from .common_schemas import UserSession, ErrorResponse
# from .ws_schemas import WSBaseMessage

# For now, we'll keep it simple and just make it a package.
